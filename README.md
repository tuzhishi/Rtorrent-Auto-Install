[https://github.com/Kerwood/Rtorrent-LXC](https://github.com/Kerwood/Rtorrent-LXC)

## Manual install
These are Bash scripts to ease the installation of rtorrent, rutorrent + plugins.

**Debian Wheezy**
The Wheezy script is of course developed for Wheezy but should run just fine on Ubuntu 13.04 and 14.04.

**Debian Jessie**
The Jessie script was adapted for the new default init system. Should run fine on systems that feature systemd (including Ubuntu 15.04+).

Please use `systemctl start rtorrent` and `systemctl stop rtorrent` instead of the service command.

**Raspbian Wheezy**
Credit for the Raspbian script goes to [miracle091](https://github.com/miracle091), good work mate.

**What the scripts do**
In the installation process you have to choose a system user to run rtorrent.
Also you will get the opportunity of installing a total of 46 plugins. See list further down.
The script add a init script that makes rtorrent start, at a possible reboot, in the
given username's screen/tmux session. Use "service rtorrent-init start" and
"service rtorrent-init stop" to start and stop rtorrent respectively.
